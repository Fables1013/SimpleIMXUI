Your public and private keys are required to authenticate yourself and fund your purchases as well as receive funds from
your sales.

These two values are passed directly to the IMXApi (as they would be when using MetaMask and IMXLink) and not saved
anywhere nor sent to anyone including the authors of this project. Feel free to look around the project and confirm for
yourself that this information is only used where required. YOU SHOULD ONLY PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WHEN YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE. YOU CANNOT USE THIS PROJECT UNTIL THESE TWO PIECES OF INFO ARE PROVIDED.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU SHARE YOU PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY AS A RESULT OF
USING THIS PROJECT.

FWIW, WHEN USING THIS I LOAD MY PRIVATE KEY FROM A TXT FILE I HAVE SAVED ON MY HARD-DRIVE. YOU CAN MIMIC THAT APPROACH BY
USING THE BELOW SYNTAX:

privateKey = open('filepath/privateKey.txt', 'r').readline()
'''

privateKey = ""
publicKey = ""
